# Introduction
This is a simple mock api created for [this](https://github.com/UPSxACE/ironhack-ecommerce-vite) project, using json server and json auth server. The db.json contains fictional data to be used in a e-commerce store.

This is one of two repositories involved in the project:
- [React Vite Frontend](https://github.com/UPSxACE/ironhack-ecommerce-vite)
- [Json Server Mock API](https://github.com/UPSxACE/ironhack-ecommerce-mockapi)

# Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Setup the `PORT` environment table with the __port in which the api should be initialized__
3. Run `npm run start`.
4. Setup the react application by following the steps in the [frontend repository](https://github.com/UPSxACE/ironhack-ecommerce-vite).

# Team Members
This was a group exercise that I completed with Ioannis Tourtouras.
